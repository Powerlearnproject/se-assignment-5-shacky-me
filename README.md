         Live Server: Launches a local development server to preview your web pages in a browser.
         ESLint: Lints JavaScript code for errors and potential improvements.


6. Integrated Terminal:
   - Describe how to open and use the integrated terminal in VS Code. What are the advantages of using the integrated terminal compared to an external terminal?
  
              Opening the Terminal:
         
         Go to Terminal > New Terminal (or View > Terminal > New Terminal).
         A new terminal panel will appear at the bottom of the VS Code window.
         Advantages:
         
         Integrates seamlessly with VS Code, allowing you to run commands and interact with your code directly within the IDE.
         Provides access to your system's command line tools.

7. File and Folder Management:
   - Explain how to create, open, and manage files and folders in VS Code. How can users navigate between different files and directories efficiently?
  
              Creating and Opening Files/Folders:
         
         Go to File > New File or New Folder (or Code > New File or New Folder on macOS) to create them.
         Existing files and folders can be opened from the Side Bar.
         Navigation:
         
         Use the Side Bar to navigate between files and folders.
         Use the Go to File command (Ctrl+G or Cmd+G) to quickly jump to specific files by name.

              Steps:
         
         Install a debugger extension specific to your programming language (e.g., C++ Debugger).
         Set breakpoints in your code to pause execution
         Launch the debugging session using the debugger extension's controls (usually a "Start Debugging" button).
         Step through your code line by line, inspect variables, and identify errors.

            Key Debugging Features:
         
         Breakpoints: Pause execution at specific lines of code.
         Call Stack: View the function call history.
         Watches: Monitor the value of variables during execution.
         Console: Interact with your program using the built-in terminal.

10. Using Source Control:
    - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.
   
                Integrating Git with VS Code:
          
          Install the Git extension in VS Code.
          Open the integrated terminal and initialize a Git repository in your project directory using git init.
          Stage changes to files using the Source Control view in VS Code.
          Commit staged changes with a descriptive message using the Source Control view.
          Connect your local repository to a remote repository on GitHub.
          Push your committed changes to the remote repository using git push.

               Benefits of using Git:
          
          Version control: Track changes to your code over time.
          Collaboration: Work with others on the same codebase.
          Backup: Recover previous versions of your code if needed.
